<p>Is there public internet access at the venue?</p>

<p>This tag is for indication that a map entity such as a building, a shop, restaurant, etc. offers internet access to the public, either as a paid service or even for free.</p>

<p>This tag could be used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet cafes</li>
  <li>Shops which offer internet as service</li>
  <li>Libraries which offer internet access</li>
  <li>Hotels, hostels or other accomodation with internet</li>
  <li>Open spaces like squares or streets with public wireless hotspots</li>
</ul>

<p>This tag should <em>not</em> be used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every internet access which is only for members or private persons, and not offered to the general public. This includes your personal home DSL, LAN, wireless, any internal networks of companies, etc.</li>
  <li>Internet access only for students (e.g. wireless hotspots on the campus) should not be tagged, because this is not a public service</li>
</ul>
