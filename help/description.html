<p>The description tag is for adding text that might be viewable to the end user. This might be used by for instance a search system or a map with pop-ups. It is recommended that the text is kept short; a few words or perhaps one to three sentences at most. Longer information can be provided by tagging a link to Wikipedia or other external website.</p>
