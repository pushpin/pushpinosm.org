<p>The operator tag is used to name a company, corporation, person or any other entity who is in charge of the operation of a certain map object.</p>

<p>Often it's useful to describe that a certain map object "belongs" to a company or corporation in any way. For example: With the emerging of private postal service providers, it may be of interest for the map user which postal services provider operates a certain post_box.</p>

<p>When choosing the appropriate value it is beneficial to use exactly the same text, including capitalization across all entries. The title of the associated Wikipedia article for the same organization may be useful as a reference.</p>
